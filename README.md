# Algo-DS-Implementations

# Fun With DSA 🚀

Welcome to my self-learning repository! This project is a collection of data structures and algorithm problems I’m solving to sharpen my coding skills, explore new patterns, and just have fun with code.

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- 💡 **Learn by Doing**: Strengthen my understanding of algorithms and data structures through practical implementation.
- 🧠 **Master Time Complexity**: Focus on writing optimal solutions with clear, efficient logic.
- 🛠 **Hands-On Java Practice**: Reinforce core Java concepts in a hands-on, problem-solving context.
- 🔍 **Explore System-Level Thinking**: Bridge the gap between coding challenges and real-world applications.
- 🚀 **Build a Growth Mindset**: Tackle challenging problems as opportunities to grow—one step at a time.
- ✨ **Have Fun!**: Code creatively, experiment freely, and enjoy the process of learning.

## 🧪 What You’ll Find Here

- ✅ Clean, well-commented Java solutions to various algorithm problems.
- 📓 Thought process, trade-offs, and design decisions captured alongside code.
- 🌱 Continuous updates as I explore more patterns and problem types.

## 🙌 Motivation

I created this space to learn, reflect, and improve as a developer. It’s a personal log of my progress and curiosity—a sandbox to build logic, debug ideas, and grow both technically and mentally.
